"""Leapfrog dispersion of Langmuir oscillations.

Use only 1st order weighting for this part. Initialize 64 cold, static, evenly
distributed particles onto a grid with 32 cells (33 grid points). Initialize a
small velocity perturbation that varies sinusoidally with a single period in x.
The velocity perturbation should be small enough to maintain harmonic
oscillations. (The particle trajectories should not cross.) Measure the
oscillation frequency from the energy history plot and compare it to the plasma
frequency. Repeat for several plasma frequency values and plot the deviation of
the measured frequency from the plasma frequency. Compare with the theoretical
result for the leap-frog instability to demonstrate phase error and
instability."""
